# sw-hack

Hack made few months ago for fun. Install nodeJS and have fun

## How to use

- Enable firewall settings for nodejs.exe - new out rule and select nodejs.exe
- Go to your phone (indeed it works on lan network) or android emulator's wifi settings and change proxy settings to match your local ip + port:8080 (local ip will be shown when running the hack too)
  Android Emulator connection should be bridge to work)
- Edit the code as u wish, run the server and you are ready to go (by default hack is disabled, read code)
- Run the game in your phone or android emulator
- When you enter a fight, if you surrender or lose, you will automatically win -> WARNING: winning in record time < 10s or a time that its imposible for your team to beat may result in a permanent ban, so use it with caution or feel free to add guards in the code.

If you don't over abuse and play legit, you won't be banned, 

Special thanks to https://github.com/kakaroto/SWProxy for the inspiration. I made it to test Com2US


Disclaimer ; this hack is intended for devs, because you need SMW AES encryption/decryption key to work.
